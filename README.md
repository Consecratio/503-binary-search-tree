#  Binary Search Tree ðŸŒ´

We are going to be implementing a Binary Tree together! ðŸŽ‰

I like to think of a Binary Tree as a pre-sorted linked list. There is a little alorithmic logic to how a BST stores the data.

To get started head over to BinaryTree.py and check out the classes there. There are method stubs that we are going to fill out together!
